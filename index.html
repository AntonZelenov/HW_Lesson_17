              FashHanger is a bespoke sustainable high-fashion accessory company
              based out of Berlin, currently operated by Siesly and her sister
              Ashely. They needed help for a big rebrand and wanted to relaunch
              their website.
            </p>
            <p>
              Their goals were simple, create a unique e-commerce store that
              bring a wonderful shopping experience at every stage of the
              buyer’s journey.

              Originally, the personality section of this persona was based off
              the Myers Briggs personality test. According to the Myers Briggs,
              there are 16 potential user personality types. Our template
              integrates questions from this online personality test example
              into a series of sliding bar graphics. If you’re confused as to
              what the sliders mean, check out the Myers Briggs basics article.

              I list out a jumble of words and draw tiny sketches related to
              what I’m working on (and find the parallels later). Personally, I
              prefer paper with a grid so I can convey things responsively. Most
              of the time perfection isn’t an issue and the sketches are just
              for me.

              I played with adding a wireframe of the website flow that would
              lead you in to each screen. For each of those screens I added a
              floating footer that allows users to see where they are in that
              particular flow and jump around as needed.” We’re digging this
              InVision-made wireframe.
